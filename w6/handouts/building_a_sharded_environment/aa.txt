small things but add up to attitude and behaviour 

add to aggreesion on the road

What taxi aggregators think they are doing : Customer oriented - closer to what the customer wants - go from point a to point b. 
But what about the larger public who dont use taxis or not in the speeding car right now?
What about the driver who has to meet this target? They speak of stress, working 13-16 hours a day to meet the targets.
Some have taken by booking then begged me to give them 10 minutes to eat dinner as it  was just after midnight and they get the most incentives from 5 to 1110 that month ...so he had not eaten.

Intrincically wrong - 
One driver gets 3 drops from e city to Whitefield (15+ km 1.5+ hours), then from there to JP nagar (22km, another 2 hours at least during the day)... 5-6 hours gone
even if middle of Blr - Infantry Road to Lavelle Road - 30 minutes - 2.6km! Other places 3.5 km - 10 minutes (example e-city toll gate to St Xavier's school Neeladri Road),
then if this driver is lucky he gets a few more within e-city or to Bommasandra ... near by. So its skewed. 

Anger, rash driving, denying trips, I have been stuck on the e-city express way, after 15 mintues,s w two taxis had collided. So a 15 minute journey became a 45 minute. Why - over speeding taxis!
I hope we can do few steps before there are deaths. When I passed the cars, could see the tell take hand sets attached to the wind shield.
Have seen a few rules being enforced only when there is death or in the news. Or a road speed breaker being built after an accident,
we have had legislation for the number of times taxi aggregators can charge over the normal fees, similarly we need to make laws to
keep their business more humane, fair and less dangerous.
